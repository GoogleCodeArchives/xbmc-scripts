#This is a memo file for features and/or todo on mypicture Database addon.

= Introduction =

Need something more in this addon ? An idea for a new feature ? Please write it down here.


= Documentation =

Need to write some documentation for skinners or addon integrators.
Documentation should cover the library (aka MyPicsDB.py) and the addon calls if a XBMC GUI skinner need to integrate it into their skin.

= Feature Requests =

* Browsing pictures using geographical IPTC metas (Country, City and Sub-location).
Need to think about how to browse those metas

* limit the number of pictures added to the container using sql syntax "LIMIT x OFFSET y" and adding a pagenumber parameter in the addon requests.
This picture per page limit has to be configurable in the settings

*

= Known bugs =

* some pictures's IPTC are not retrieved. Bug known but don't know yet what is the reason.

* some pictures are a lot slower than others to scan. Don't know why

* ...

= Todos =

* It is better to remove some dead code.

* remove the excessive commentary records, beginning with # or """

* have too many debug messages in the add-on

* use an code beatifier like http://quickhighlighter.com/

* write some kind of documentation for skinners and library integrator (see [documentation#Documentation] section
